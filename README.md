## Contains my own projects:
* * *
1. Login Form with Signup
2. To Do List
3. Chrome Extension (Lead Tracker):
    * I employed query method along with the Chrome Tab API to interact with the browser tab system(Modifying the manifest). 
    * Additionally, I implemented the capability to store data in the Local Storage, for saving previous inputs in case of any loss. 
    * For icons, I used fontawesome.com to download the external resource into my package folder and load the script locally. I did this for the following reason: according to the Chrome Extension documentation, Google Chrome has CSP (Content Security Policy), which means chrome extensions don't allow the external script.
